# Hypatos Coding Challenge

## How to run the code:

### Packages to Install before Running:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) -> pip install pandas
- [Levenshtein](https://pypi.org/project/python-Levenshtein/) -> pip install python-Levenshtein
- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) -> pip install argparse

**OR**

Run the following command when in the same directory with the code:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run:

You should have python version 3.6+

> python *\<ground_truth_file_name\>* *\<extraction_file_name\>* *\<output_file_name\>*

The output will be created in the same directory as the code with the output name given. 


## Challenge Description

To summarize, the challenge asks us to compare the extraction file, which is generated by hypatos model that extracts data from documents,
with the ground truth and measure accuracy for the line items.

## Challenge Solution Steps

### 1. Match each line item in the ground truth file with an item in the extraction file 

To do this matching, description ...

### 2. Compare matched items 

Comparison

### 3. Evaluation

Error evaluation
