The output will be created in the same directory as the code with the output name given. 


## Challenge Description

To summarize, the challenge asks us to compare the extraction file, which is generated by hypatos model that extracts data from documents, \
with the ground truth and measure accuracy for the line items.

## Challenge Solution Steps

# 1. Match each line item in the ground truth file with an item in the extraction file \

To do this matching, description ...

# 2. Compare matched items 

Comparison

# 3. Evaluation
